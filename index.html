             <h1>Minimize light and sound</h1>
             <p>These two environmental factors can impact your quality and quantity of sleep. Darkness causes your brain to release melatonin for a calming, sleepy effect. As a result, it's important to minimize your exposure to light before bedtime. Even the light from your computer, TV or other devices might make it more difficult for you to fall asleep.</p>
             <p>Ban these devices from your bedroom, and create a dark space by using blackout shades or an eye mask. Noise also can interfere with your ability to sleep. Try using a fan or a noise machine to block out unwanted noises.</p>

             <h1>Get comfortable.</h1>
             <p>Adults spend about a third of their lives asleep, so it's worthwhile to invest in bedding that comforts and relaxes you. Before climbing into bed, try lowering your thermostat a few degrees.</p>
             <p>temperature drops during rest, and keeping your room on the chilly side will aid in this natural temperature drop.</p>

             <h1> Keep a routine.</h1>
             <p>Just like kids, adults sleep better when they have a bedtime routine. Doing the same thing before bed each night can help prepare your body for rest and condition your brain for sleep.</p>
             <p> Stick to activities that promote relaxation, such as gentle stretching,  writing in a journal, reading or meditation.</p>

             <p>How you handle stress can play a significant role in your ability to fall and stay asleep. While stress isn't all bad, when it turns into worry or anxiety, it can disrupt your sleep.</p>
